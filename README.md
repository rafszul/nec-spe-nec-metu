# WITHOUT HOPE, WITHOUT FEAR

During a visit to a church in Sicily a priest offered a painter Caravaggio holy water. Caravaggio asked the old priest what was it for. "It will cancel your venial sins my son." replied the priest. "Then it's no use" replied Caravaggio, "because my sins are all mortal."

this is a project about an Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi better known as Caravaggio and a search for architectual glimpses of the reality in which he lived and which he depicted in unprecedented detail on his paintings.

since I like having something in place before diving deep in technologies, assets etc i patched up something to statr with, something that inspires me, allows to agther materials and something dramatic enough to maybe draw some attention from fellow coders and creatives.

at this stage I often use already available open source compositions by others and JavaScript used here was initialy written by Gerard Ferrandez ([ge1doot](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/)) whose work was always an inspiration for me. his original demo could be viewed here: [apparently transparent](http://codepen.io/ge1doot/pen/GgOYoy) appart from that the [source code together with the MIT licence could be accessed here](https://gist.github.com/rafszul/80e9bc30dc6a5beca0ac5839d37a2745).

the painting are all by already mentioned, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and this repo is a start of a journey to recreate in JavaScript the places visited by this extraordinary artist during his lifetime... all in webGL... with vr gear on...

to be continued...
